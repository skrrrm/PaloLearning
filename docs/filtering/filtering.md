# Filtering

With next generation firewalls, it's possible to filter based on a lot more than just ports, IPs and subnets. The next-gen firewall can filter traffic based on:

* App-ID
* User-ID (can be integrated with LDAP)
* Content-ID (Deep-packet inspection - hash signatures)
* Service Profiles (URL-, file, filtering, Anti-malware)
